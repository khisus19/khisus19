### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

_You are on your way home without a worry on your mind when you suddenly see a monster lurking along the way. You're in trouble since there is only one road leading home._

This is the description to a game called _Monster Road_ that came in the __Casio FX-750p__ personal computer.

Around 20 years ago, I was starting high school and one of my uncles came to me and said "I have a gift for you". He gave me this thing. A thing of beauty and awe for me. Been like I was, from a small town in The Andes mountains of Venezuela, I had never been in touch with a programable hardware before. I fell in love with the device right away. 

With its 27KB ROM memory, a 4KB RAM memory card and a one line 24 characters long LCD with no backlight, I felt I could do anything with it. It came with a great manual that it was more like book for learning BASIC programming language. With it I programmed a Yu-Gi-Oh duel points tracker, an average calculator for my high school grades and a program to track the position of La Liga football teams (I'm a huge Real Madrid fan, Hala Madrid!). 

That was my introduction to programming. From there the passion kind of fade out. I went to college and studied Physics (another of my passions), worked as a teacher and started a family.

I was able to leave Venezuela with my family in 2021. Then I started my journey to become a Web developer. I am now fulfilling the dream to write code for a living using technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Jest Unit testing and Git/Github.

If you got this far make sure to contact me. I am always available for new experiences in this wonderful world of technology.
